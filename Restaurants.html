	    		<div class="clear_it"></div>  
	    		<img  src="images/r1.jpg" alt="restaurant" /> 
	    		<p>Considering its location less than half a block from the Pantheon, a major Roman tourist attraction, it's no surprise that Armando al Pantheon books up well in advance. What is shocking—and novel—is that in a sea of traps, the Gargioli family dedicates every waking hour to serving genuine, thoughtful Roman specialties guided by seasonal, quality ingredients. This has landed Armando al Pantheon in every major travel magazine and guidebook many times over. But the hype is fully deserved.</p>

	    		<h2> MORDI E VAI</h2>
	    		<img  src="images/r2.jpg" alt="restaurant" /> 
	    		<p>When the Testaccio Market re-opened in 2012 in a larger, more modern space than its predecessor, it paved the way for the arrival of new small businesses. Though Rome's markets traditionally sell raw ingredients, Mordi e Vai, which occupies a stall in the market's eastern side, serves sandwiches made to order, snacks and prepared foods intended to be eaten on the fly. For around €3, patrons can have a, homemade-tasting bite prepared by owner Sergio Esposito based on family recipes</p>

	    		<h2>L'ARCANGELO</h2>
	    		<img  src="images/r3.jpg" alt="restaurant" /> 
	    		<p>Arcangelo Dandini is the one of Rome's most beloved chefs, a man who embraces seasonal, traditional recipes of the Italian capital. Though he is not precisely a Rome native—he grew up in Rocca Priora, a town on a hill 15 miles southeast of the city—he cooks Roman classics, as well as the specialities of his home town; due to its distance from Rome and its geography, Rocca Priora's Roman cuisine is not identical to its urban neighbor. His dishes are inspired by time spent in family members' home and restaurant kitchens, but he also seeks to recreate specialties of the Roman Renaissance and even ancient delicacies.</p>
