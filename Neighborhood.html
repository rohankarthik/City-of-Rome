	    	<p>One neighborhood that often gets overlooked in Rome is the quartiere Monti. Though its location is key (smack dab in the middle of the Centro Storico and right down the street from the Colosseum), if you don't know what you're looking for, you could easily pass through here it without even realizing that you've stumbled upon a true gem. From artsy bookstore cafés to lovely little piazzas where you could spend the day sipping on cappuccinos to ethnic eatieres and not to mention gelato! 10Best gives you the scoop on why you can't pass up this hip neighborhood.</p>

	    	<h2>San Lorenzo District</h2>	
	    	<img  src="images/n2.jpg" alt="neighborhood" /> 
	    	<p>Over the last few years, the San Lorenzo district of Rome has been dubbed the city's up-and-coming neighborhood largely thanks to its bohemian vibe and the hip centro sociali (underground bars) sprinkled throughout the area. If you're tired of Centro or Testaccio's nightlife, give San Lorenzo a try. </p>	    
	    	<div class="clear_it"></div>  	    	
	    	<h2>Centro Storico</h2>
	    	<img  src="images/n3.jpg" alt="neighborhood" /> 
	    	<p>For tourists looking to be in the cuore (heart) of it all, the best place to be in Rome is in the centro storico. Indeed, the historic center of the city is where a chunk of the Eternal City's main attractions are located. The best part is that most of it can be covered on foot. From taking that postcard perfect photo in front of the immense Pantheon to enjoying the lovely street café scene at Piazza Navona, the centro storico has it all!</p>
